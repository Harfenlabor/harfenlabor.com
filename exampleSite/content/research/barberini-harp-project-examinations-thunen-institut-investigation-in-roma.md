Harfenlabor invited wood scientists Volker Haag and Valentina Zemke of the Institut für Holzforschung, Thünen-Institut, Hamburg, to investigate the wood species used for the construction of the Barberini Harp. For the first time ever the wood on the Harp’s column was examined using new non-invasive methodology. The investigation took place at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali, Roma, on December 16-18, 2018.

As the most important remaining Baroque harp, the Barberini Harp is under a strict conservation protocol. In close consultation with the museum’s management, Haag and Zemke used the non-destructive high-resolution 3D-reflected-light microscopy. Their delicate examinations produced material that was then transported to Hamburg for analysis and comparisons. Studio Armin Linke documented the various steps of this scientific process.
