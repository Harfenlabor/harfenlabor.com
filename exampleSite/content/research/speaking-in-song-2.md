Ottavio Dantone, conductor, outstanding cembalo and organ player and a basso continuo autodidact, demonstrates the power of music and word through some of the key moments in Monteverdi´s masterpiece _L'Orfeo_. Dantone shares his visionary views on the modernity of Monteverdi´s musical language, advocating for intuition in adapting performances to contemporary needs so as to electrify through synergy of music and words.
