In 2018, Harfenlabor asked Institut für Holzforschung at the Thünen-Institut (Hamburg) to, for the first time ever, examine the wood on the Barberini Harp’s column and other parts (some of which have been examined using different methods) using new non-invasive methodology, and identify the wood species used in the construction of the instrument. On 16-18 December, 2018, wood scientists Volker Haag and Valentina Zemke carried out anatomical determination of structural features on the harp, at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali (Roma). Following their report, Harfenlabor interviewed Haag in Hamburg, in November 2019, in order to better understand the science and the processes involved in both identifying wood species used in the construction of historical instruments, and to understand the biology behind properties that make certain woods more suitable as tone woods than others.
