Harfenlabor presents an online lecture held on Zoom, on April 17th, 2021, on <span id="person_tag">Giovanni Girolamo Kaspberger</span> with two speakers: <span id="person_tag">Anne Marie Dragosits</span>, harpsichord player, with “New information on Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger - with special focus on his material for the basso continuo”; and <span id="person_tag">Michele Pasotti</span>, lutenist, with “Passaggi per suonare sopra la parte. Kapsberger and other <span id="timeline_tag">17th century</span> Italian sources for basso continuo on the theorbo.”

This lecture on Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger places a special focus on Kapsberger’s vision of a good continuo player accompanying the voice, as demonstrated in his published material for basso continuo. In historical performance practice, plucked instruments, as well as keyboard instruments very often shared the repertoire—historical harpists therefore find great benefit in researching material written for theorbo, or lute. Both Dragosits and Pasotti are also continuo players with valuable insights into Kapsberger realisations and treatises.

Dragosits is also the author of the recently published biography, <span id="subjects_tag">_Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger “Ein ziemlich extravaganter Mann”_</span> (Lucca: Lim, 2020).

Moderated by <span id="person_tag">Margret Köll</span>, historical harpist and artistic director of Harfenlabor
