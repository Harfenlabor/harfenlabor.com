Following the <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini Harp</span> <span id="subjects_tag">wood species investigation</span> by the Thünen-Institut's Institut für Holzforschung in <span id="map_tag">Roma</span>, in 2019 Harfenlabor interviewed wood scientist <span id="person_tag">Volker Haag</span> who conducted the investigation with his colleague <span id="person_tag">Valentina Zemke</span>, to explain the findings and scientific process behind identifying the wood species used in the construction of this harp. The interview takes place in the scientist's context at the Institut für Holzforschung in <span id="map_tag">Hamburg</span>: his desk, his electronic scientific tools as well as wood samples held by the Thünen-Institut that Haag uses for comparison and analysis. 

With the generous support of the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali, Istituto Storico Austriaco and the Deutsche Botschaft in Rom.
