Following the Barberini Harp wood species investigation by the Thünen-Institut's Institut für Holzforschung in Roma, in 2019 Harfenlabor interviewed wood scientist Volker Haag who conducted the investigation with his colleague Valentina Zemke, to explain the findings and scientific process behind identifying the wood species used in the construction of this harp. The interview takes place in the scientist's context at the Institut für Holzforschung in Hamburg: his desk, his electronic scientific tools as well as wood samples held by the Thünen-Institut that Haag uses for comparison and analysis. 

were compared with data held in the scientific wood collection at the Thünen Institut, and with databases of macro and micro wood data. Volker Haag presented the findings in a report to Harfenlabor, dated February 18, 2019.

Armin documented the steps... the scientific process.

After Roma the work continued at Thünen-Institut, at the Institut für Holzforschung
