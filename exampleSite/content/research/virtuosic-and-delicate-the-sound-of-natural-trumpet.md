Andreas Lackner, a natural trumpet pioneer and an enthusiastic teacher of his instrument from East Tyrol, talks about how hard it was hitting the notes on natural trumpet in his early days, about the formative and inspiring experiences with the legendary ensemble Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and his ambitious education project, the Alpine Brass Band Academy. Lackner shares his deep appreciation of the virtuosic and delicate trumpet repertoire.
