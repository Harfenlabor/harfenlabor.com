**Translated transcript of the podcast:**

**Margret Köll**: \[00:00:30\] Welcome Andreas!

**Andreas Lackner**: \[00:00:34\] Welcome!

**Köll**: \[00:00:34\] You are known as being either the first, or among the first to play the natural trumpet in Tyrol. How did you get acquainted with this instrument? How did your first encounter unfold?

**Lackner**: \[00:00:53\] It is probably correct to say that I was the first in Tyrol—at that time we were not many. That first encounter was in 1988, when I was studying music at the Mozarteum Innsbruck. Our chorus master was <span id="person_tag">Howard Arman</span>. Most of you probably know him, as he is now the artistic director of the Bavarian Radio Chorus in München. He was the reference point for many students interested in Early Music; he was also the artistic director of the Wiltener Sängerknaben \[Wiltenʼs Boys choir\]; and he organised the performance of the Weihnachtshistorie \[Christmas Story\] by Schütz in November 1988. \[For this,\] he put together an Early Music ensemble, that is, musicians playing historical instruments and the soloists of the Wiltener Sängerknaben. This work contains the aria of Herodes with two solo trumpets. Two weeks before the premiere he asked me and a colleague whether we wanted to try to play the natural trumpet. Until then I didn’t even know what natural trumpet was like. He provided the instruments, and we had two weeks to try make it work. In our small room it seemed we have succeeded. At the performance, however, our success was quite moderate: we were out of tune 50% of the time. I was very annoyed with this instrument. I thought, “I have enough work on the modern trumpet, I donʼt really need this.” In the same period, a new professor joined the Mozarteum, Karl Steininger, the solo trumpet of the Wiener Symphoniker, who also played in Concentus Musicus \[Wien\] under Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Two months later, during a lesson, he asked whether any of us had ever played natural trumpet. I said that I did, but that I didn’t like it so much. He asked me to play something for him, which I did. He offered me an engagement at the beginning of March, six weeks away, on a concert at the Musikverein Wien, in the Goldener Saal with <span id="person_tag">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span>ʼs Symphonies and the Wiener Akademie under the baton of Martin Haselböck. I didnʼt have many gigs as a student, so I was very excited and said, “Yes, letʼs do it.” He put a trumpet in my hand, explained some concepts, and that was my training. I practiced by myself and I was probably better than the person who played before me in the ensemble. This was the beginning. Things developed very fast, to the point at which a year later I was overwhelmed by engagements. I began to really like it; I threw myself into it completely, studying a lot.

**Köll**: \[00:04:45\] How were things with Harnoncourt? Did he give you some tips? Did he work with you to achieve an ideal trumpet sound?

**Lackner**: \[00:05:01\] When I first met the Concentus Musicus Wien, <span id="person_tag">Friedemann Immer</span> was already with them. He was already an institution on the Early Music scene, and I learned a lot from him, because I always watched what he was doing. Nikolaus Harnoncourt always had a clear idea, a clear picture of what he wanted from us. He did not really ask that we sound as if in the 17th and the 18th century. He instead had the idea to look for the sound he had in his mind, which had resulted from his research. It was an incredible school—I worked with him for over twenty-five years—from the initial musical idea to the performance, process repeated, over and over again; it never ceased, over the many years it remained what it was in the first year.

**Köll**: \[00:06:17\] What fascinated you so much? Was it the instrument, or also the repertoire and the music?

**Lackner**: \[00:06:25\] All of the Baroque music, from Early to Late Baroque, is of greatest interest to us trumpet players, because there is so much literature, and it sometimes demands extreme virtuosity, it is really a big challenge to play these pieces. This special sound fascinated me the most. The closeness, for example, of an oboe and a trumpet: they have such a similar sound texture that in the <span id="person_tag">Georg Philipp Telemann</span>ʼs Tafelmusik you are unable to distinguish one from another. This sound, also in this interplay with the sound of the strings, is what grabbed me at the beginning and just never lets me go.

**Köll**: \[00:07:28\] You are also an enthusiastic teacher. What is your teaching approach? Are your students practicing on the modern or on the natural trumpet? What is your concept?

**Lackner**: \[00:07:48\] The concept was forged according to what the institutions needed and allowed. I did not have extra \[lesson\] hours available to teach my students natural trumpet, so I did it during normal lessons. The method is based on my own path; it starts by achieving a strong technique on a modern instrument, and then one builds up to the historical instrument. The trumpet parts \[in Early Music\] are technically so difficult and demanding that you don’t have any leeway. You have to be a really good wind instrument player to cope with natural trumpet.

**Köll**: \[00:08:51\] You have also to serve it on a silver platter.

**Lackner**: \[00:08:56\] Yes, that’s just one thing more. Actually, you have to present every single note.

**Köll**: \[00:09:04\] What is your general opinion on Early Music \[education\]? Does it make sense to have a school of Early Music, or of the trumpet in particular? Or should it be more integrated? What is your vision?

**Lackner**: \[00:09:22\] Not everyone will be happy with my theory. According to my experience, it is not really useful for students to throw themselves too early or exclusively into the natural trumpet—I am talking here about my instrument. I have been doing this for thirty years and I have to say that many excellent colleagues I meet have background in the modern instrument. They are perfectly trained instrumentalists who had at a certain point reached to the Early Music for very different reasons. They really liked the literature or the sound of the instrument, so they gained a lot of satisfaction from Early Music and stayed there. An early dedication to the historical instrument when one’s technical background is still poor is not always such a good idea, you don’t achieve the very best results. Therefore, I advocate that you join \[the studies\]. At least as far as it concerns my instrument. There are then also the people so fascinated by the historical instrument, that they enter further education to specialise in natural trumpet. I don’t think that fully dedicated studies are necessary, but it would be good to have a more extensive education, not only focused on the instrument, but one that enlightens the whole thing with information about what you are doing, and so on.

**Köll**: \[00:11:31\] Could you tell us something about articulation on the trumpet? Would you explain how it works on your instrument and what is important?

**Lackner**: \[00:11:46\] I make it simple: the most important is this uniformity and regularity, the 4/16, 4/16, that you don’t have in Baroque music, where you have an extreme freedom. That’s why they say that Early Music and Jazz have a lot in common. This is true with regard to articulation, because there is so much freedom in the ancient music; there are of course a couple of rules to follow, but in between there is so much freedom. When you look at the exercises in the 17th century schools, you’ll see there are always syllables written below, there are figures of five notes upwards and under them you find DA-DE-DI-DE-DUM. Through this text, this language form, you get the phrasing. For us, the text is like a measure, when we have a text, it is completely clear how the phrasing works. How does it work technically? Sometimes when I play, there are situations in which less than perfect technique could help a lot. You have to, simply, use things to your advantage and this results in excellent phrasing. At music high schools where orchestral training has the main role, you learn to play everything in a completely regular and perfect way. For us, in the Early Music, this is absolutely not important, because this movement doesn’t occur when we have chains of semiquavers and you play every single semiquaver in the same way. You can only produce something very boring. You have to \[think\] about the language, the melody, about how the melodic arcs continue, you can actually do a lot with great freedom, and everybody can produce their own result, which can be interesting and very colourful.

**Köll**: \[00:14:30\] You have been on the Early Music scene for a long time. This scene has changed a lot over the years. If you look at the future, let’s say in five or ten years, how will it develop? You can look at this from the music education perspective too, how can it influence the Early Music scene?

**Lackner**: \[00:14:57\] This is a very difficult question: at the moment it seems to me that the scene is saturated, that anything you could do has been already done. Actually, a lot of literature has not been researched yet. You could, for instance, verify if some compositions are worthy of being unearthed, there is still an immense amount of work. As performers we don’t manage to do this due to the lack of time, but also because it is a question of money: you need to hire a musicologist to meticulously explore all the libraries. Certainly, there would be a lot to do.

**Köll**: \[00:15:52\] Do you mean music literature for the trumpet?

**Lackner**: \[00:15:54\] Sure, literature for the trumpet. So much has not yet been performed. There are still many black spots when it comes to the choice of instrument. For example, in <span id="person_tag">Johann Sebastian Bach</span>’s cantatas you can have a remark about the instrument, but nobody knows which instrument it is. Harnoncourt often said that it does not designate the instrument but the way you have to play it. For example, in a Bach cantata there was this tromba da tirarsi, and he wanted us trumpet players to play the chorals on ancient tromboni. At the beginning we didn’t even know how we could approach this instrument, but it worked very well. When you understand how to deal with the mouth piece, you can play Bach’s chorals very well on the trombone. There is also this closeness between trumpet and horn, which were not so strongly separated at that time. I remember a <span id="person_tag">Georg Friederich Händel</span>’s oratorio where you have trumpets at the beginning and at the end. In the middle, there is a choir piece with two horns, so Harnoncourt wanted us trumpet players to play the horn parts on horns. We did that and it worked very well.

**Köll**: \[00:17:36\] Did you need to practice a lot for this?

**Lackner**: \[00:17:39\] Yes, of course, we needed time to get used to the mouth piece, to find the right material, but it was wonderful to get there and it was very exciting. And we did it from time to time, I mean <span id="person_tag">Herbert Walser</span> and I, we played the high horn parts.

**Köll**: \[00:18:06\] Herbert Walser, with whom you played a lot—this is a good point for listening to some music.

**Lackner**: \[00:18:16\] We are going to listen to the Con discretione movement from the first Sonata by <span id="person_tag">Romanus Weichlein</span>, from Encaenia Musices, performed by Ars Antiqua Austria under <span id="person_tag">Gunar Letzbor</span> with Herbert Walser and me. I am the trumpet player.

**Köll**: \[00:23:28\] Very beautiful! Weichlein!

**Lackner**: \[00:23:31\] Romanus Weichlein! A terrific piece that shows how delicate the trumpet can be in a dialogue with two violins, two violas and the continuo, it works very well. When you hear the trumpet, you usually have the feeling that it is loud, heroic, but it also can be very \[delicate\].

**Köll**: \[00:23:58\] Thinking about the solo cantatas, there is a sense that trumpet playing is a team sport.

**Lackner**: \[00:24:05\] Yes, it is. There are many sonatas and concerts for two, or even three trumpets, even whole cantatas by Bach. The three trumpets distribution was very important for Bach, Telemann and Händel, from two up to four trumpets. In Caldara and in the opera you often have eight trumpets, that is, four choirs, each with the corresponding instruments, everything was possible. In Innsbruck, during the golden age of <span id="person_tag">Maximilian I</span>, there were twenty-four court trumpet players. This was, of course, a status symbol: the more trumpets a ruler had for appearances, the more important he was considered to be.

**Köll**: \[00:25:03\] Yes, the trumpets were a beautiful, important attribute of authority. You also have a big brass band project, maybe you could say something about it for our audience? What are your plans and what does this arc from the Early Music to brass band projects mean to you?

**Lackner**: \[00:25:31\] Indeed, it is a big jump. This project started about twelve years ago, during a stay in Venezuela within the El Sistema project; we were four teachers from Europe and four from the Americas and gave a workshop there. I was impressed by the power of that big group—we worked with a symphony orchestra of mostly young musicians—and I was overwhelmed by the energy that came out. During the ten days of teaching, I noticed that we didn’t have the very best players, we had from the very good up to discrete players. But they were perfect when playing together, and I thought I’d like something like that for my students, including those of the music school where I teach an afternoon a week. We thought about what we could do and it came to me, the brass band. I also played in one when I was a student. The Adolphe Sax’s instrument family, from the cornet to the saxhorn, the baritone to the euphonium: this mix of colours fascinated me, or fascinated me for the second time, in the way the Early Music did, so my pedagogical attitude made me consider this repertoire, which mostly comes from England and is terribly virtuosic for us brass players—you find things there that never occur in literature. Considering how young pupils and students don’t like to practice all day long, we thought about what could help and turned to the brass band we started twelve years ago with the youth brass band project. The project quickly earned a huge success, because when you stimulate and stimulate young people, you can achieve incredible things, and this project, based at the Innsbruck music school, actually achieved a big success. Every year there is a European competition in which brass bands love to compete. Their origin lies in the English coal mines, and the mills and factories of the 19th century. So, they began to compete for the best band, and this still goes on, every year a European competition takes place. We won it in 2019 in Montreaux, Switzerland, against the English and Swiss bands, which are, obviously, leading in the field, whilst in Austria, the brass band is still a neglected ensemble. I am trying to further develop this project because I noticed that it helps the band-player students improve their skills. They also learn the discipline you need to play chorally together, which is unusual for wind instrument players because trumpet players in orchestra usually play solos. This is good for them, as they move on in sharpening their technique.

**Köll**: \[00:30:02\] And probably their social skills too.

**Lackner**: \[00:30:06\] Of course, by being together all the time and reacting to each other, but this is the case with any orchestra or big ensemble. This is fantastic because they learn things that are very difficult to teach in another way.

**Köll**: \[00:30:26\] Are the workshops open to others too? If you are interested, where can you look for them?

**Lackner**: \[00:30:26\] Yes, they are. Seven years ago, I founded the Alpine Brass Band Academy \[[https://brassbandacademy.at](https://brassbandacademy.at "https://brassbandacademy.at")\] that took place four times. Unfortunately, it was interrupted by Covid-19, but this year it will take place again at the end of July. We used to gather in Toblach or Dobbiaco, in Northern Tyrol, in Stift Stams, but this year we will be in my home town of Lienz, in Eastern Tyrol.

**Köll**: \[00:31:12\] How beautiful, hopefully a lot of people will come! At the end of our conversation I would like to ask you to recommend some recordings to make the new generations fall in love with Early Music and perhaps with the natural trumpet.

**Lackner**: \[00:31:30\] There are of course many. <span id="person_tag">Niklas Ecklund</span> recorded many trumpet concertos twenty years ago, these are excellent recordings. All of the Bach cantata recordings by <span id="person_tag">John Eliot Gardiner</span>… there are so many fantastic recordings. The best would be to simply choose a renowned ensemble on historical instruments, taking into consideration also the new generation ensembles that are emerging. These swarms of young generation artists in every instrumental genre fascinate me—I notice this in particular with my instrument—when I began, the main reference where the English musicians and their \[natural\] trumpet with four vent holes. Friedemann Immer was very active on the French and German natural trumpet scene, playing on the trumpet with three vent holes. Since then, the trumpet without vent holes has gained in importance. I was very sceptical about it at first, till I found my approach. Nowadays, there are terrific wind instrument players who can do incredible things on the trumpet without vent holes.

**Köll**: \[00:33:14\] Why did the vent hole become so important?

**Lackner**: \[00:33:14\] You mean the vent hole question. We’ve always used these vent holes to make playing in tune easier on natural trumpet, but this is not historically documented. In the middle of the 18th century, there are trumpets with different transposing devices and vent holes, but we don’t know exactly how they turned up. There are thousands of theses on how it would have worked: from a leaky instrument to \[a trumpet\] with or without vent holes. The vent holes \[were introduced\] to be able to come closer to the modern audience’s taste. People are not used to \[the natural trumpet\] and they hear half of the natural tones as too high or too low. In the meantime, a large movement appeared approaching this in a very purist way. I am very open about this. I think that everybody has to do what suits them best in order to achieve something good.

**Köll**: \[00:34:46\] Very, very good. I hope that many are going to learn the natural trumpet. It seems we don’t have to worry about the new generations, as we’ve just heard. Over the past thirty years we have experienced a rapid increase in demand.

**Lackner**: \[00:35:08\] We are in high demand, of course. This is always a financial matter, as there is a lot to do and everyone has endless engagements. If I look at the trumpet scene in Innsbruck, we have more than twenty wonderful trumpet players, starting from about twenty-five to my age, who are all working, sometimes all at the same time, and it is probably the same in other places. In any case, it is worth knowing the historical background of your instrument.

**Köll**: \[00:36:06\] Many, many thanks, Andreas.

**Lackner**: \[00:36:28\] You are welcome, and thank you for the invitation!
