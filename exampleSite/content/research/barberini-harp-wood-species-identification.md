barberiniharpproject = "The most important surviving Italian Baroque harp, the Barberini Harp, is a chromatic harp with three parallel rows of strings constructed (1632-33) for the harpist Marco Marazzoli by the instrument maker Girolamo Acciari and the wood-carver Giovanni Tubi under the patronage of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. As we lack crucial understanding of this famous harp, Harfenlabor has initiated The Barberini Harp Project in order to conduct and share basic research on this harp in the fields of organology, musicology, and performance practice and within relevant historical and art-historical contexts. This publication presents three stages of The Barberini Harp Project: 1. Convening around the Barberini Harp Project 2. Interviews with Experts and 3. Examinations."

description = "In 2018, Harfenlabor asked Institut für Holzforschung at the Thünen-Institut (Hamburg) to, for the first time ever, examine the wood on the Barberini Harp’s column and other parts (some of which have been examined using different methods) using new non-invasive methodology, and identify the wood species used in the construction of the Barberini Harp. On December 16-18, 2018, Volker Haag and Valentina Zemke from the Institut für Holzforschung carried out anatomical determination of structural features on the harp, at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali (Roma). In close consultation with the museum’s management, Haag and Zemke used the non-destructive high-resolution 3D-reflected-light microscopy in their investigation. This technology includes integrated image analysis software enabling production of flat observation surfaces in order to identify structural features of wood. Structural features detected on the examined areas of the harp were compared with data held in the scientific wood collection at the Thünen-Institut, and with macroHOLZdata and microHOLZdata (the two databases developed at the Institut für Holzforschung). Volker Haag presented the findings in a report to Harfenlabor, dated February 18, 2019.&&\n"

###### In December 2018, the team from the <span id="subjects_tag">Thünen-Institut</span>, <span id="subjects_tag">Institut für Holzforschung</span> transported comprehensive microscopy equipment from <span id="map_tag">Hamburg</span> to <span id="map_tag">Roma</span> for this investigation. At the heart of this equipment is a state-of-the-art <span id="subjects_tag">3D-RLM</span> (3D-reflected-light microscopy) microscope. This advanced technology enables a completely non-destructive material analysis that allows identification of the types of wood that the harp was built of. The scientists’ repertoire of tools also includes a custom computer with specialist image analysis software, as well as various eyepieces and stands for different applications. In February 2019, Thünen-Institut, Institut für Holzforschung shared their findings with Harfenlabor in the  [Thünen-Institut Wood Species Identification Report](https://www.harfenlabor.com/research/thunen-wood-species-identification-report/).
