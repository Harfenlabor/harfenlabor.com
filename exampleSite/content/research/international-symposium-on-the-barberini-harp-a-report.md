A harp commissioned by the influential aristocratic Barberini family was built in Roma, probably in 1632. It remains preserved to this day as one of the most valuable Italian musical instruments of the 17th century: the “Arpa Barberini” \[Barberini Harp\], an elaborately made instrument with a magnificent carved and gilded column. It bears the Barberini coat of arms and other symbolic decoration. Soon after the harp was made, the Roman painter Giovanni Lanfranco (1582-1647) immortalized the instrument in a painting, suggesting special appreciation for the harp in the artistic circles around the Barberini Pope Urbano VIII (Maffeo Barberini, reign 1623-1644. Privately owned for a long time, the instrument thus survived the passage of time; it was not handed over to the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali in Roma until the early 1970s. It remains in the museum’s collection today, though it can no longer be played for conservation reasons.

Despite its undisputed historical value, the "Arpa Barberini" is far from having been adequately researched. For this reason, an interdisciplinary conference was held at the Austrian Historical Institute in Roma in December 2016 at the initiative of the Berlin-based harpist Margret Köll. Harpists, instrument makers, musicologists and art historians from several countries met, discussed problems and questions relating to the Barberini Harp and explored the possibilities of creating an exact copy of the instrument.

14 December 2016

The Convening began in the afternoon of December 14, 2016, with the participants gathering in the exhibition room of the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali, where the Barberini Harp is kept. Following opening remarks by the initiator Margret Köll and the museum director Sandra Suatoni, an extraordinary concert was held. Only a few metres from the original Barberini Harp, three copies of the instrument were set up: by David Brown (made in Baltimore in 1989), Dario Pontiggia (in Milano, 2006) and Eric Kleinmann (in Rangendingen, 2005). Mara Galassi (Milano), Chiara Granata (Milano) and Loredana Gintoli (Berlin) played 17the century compositions on these harps in an homage to the Barberini Harp.

Using excerpts from letters, Alexandra Ziane (Berlin) then reconstructed the efforts in the late 1960s by the American curator Emanuel Winternitz (1898–1983) to transfer the Barberini Harp from a private Italian collection to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Arts. Ziane’s presentation was followed by a tour of the museum with the director Sandra Suatoni, including of the newly designed that was not yet open to the public.

The next morning, harpist and researcher Chiara Granata and harp maker Dario Pontiggia presented the current state of research on the Barberini Harp. As part of her research in the Barberini Archives of the Vatican Library, Granata was able to prove that a harp was built in 1632/33 on behalf of Cardinal Antonio Barberini for the composer and harpist Marco Marazzoli. It is very likely that this is the Barberini Harp, especially as older dendrochronological investigations dated the wood of the soundbox to between 1605 and 1610. However, Chiara Granata also pointed out the differences between the surviving instrument and the depiction of a harp in Lanfranco's painting, which exist in a number of details (color, shape, position of the sound holes, etc.).

Ursula Verena Fischer Pace (Roma) then situated design of the Barberini Harp within the art-historical context of Roman culture in the first decades of the 17th century. Fischer Pace presented a drawing by the Roman architect Giovanni Battista Soria (1581–1651), depicting a model for a harp. This resulted in a very lively discussion about the meaning of the gilded figures on the harp’s column. Three carved male figures can be seen in the middle and directly above them two clearly younger boys draped in lionskin. Florian Bassani (Bern) suggested the following interpretation for this pictorial program: the three male figures represent the pope's three nephews Francesco (1597-1679, cardinal), Taddeo (1603-1647, Prefect of Rome, Prince of Palestrina) and Antonio (1607-1671, cardinal). The two boys represent the two sons of Taddeo (i.e. the pope’s great-nephews), who were born just when the harp was built: Carlo (1630–1704, cardinal) and Maffeo jr. (1631–1685, Prince of Palestrina). The lion skin could be an allusion to the ancient hero Hercules, as a synonym for great power and inviolability of the papal Barberini family.

The art historian Elisabetta Frullini (Roma/Wien) took Giovanni Lanfranco's famous painting "Allegory of Music" as the starting point for her presentation. Frullini pointed out the important role played by Marco Marazzoli as the Barberini court musician, and presented comparable paintings.
