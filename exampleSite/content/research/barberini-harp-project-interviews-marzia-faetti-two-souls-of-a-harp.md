In 2019, Harfenlabor interviewed Marzia Faetti, the then director of the Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe at Le Gallerie degli Uffizi, Firenze. Faetti provides valuable art historical context for music iconography within the graphic art of the sixteenth and seventeenth century preserved at the Uffizi. Faetti's analysis of a preparatory drawing, often attributed to Giovanni Batista Soria, for a richly decorated harp with an unusually sumptuously decorated column, offers a fascinating insight into the aesthetic, musical, political, ceremonial and economic importance of such an instrument. This drawing is believed to be a preparatory drawing for the Barberini Harp, now preserved at the Museo Nazionale dei Strumenti Musicali, Roma. The matter of whether the drawing is by Soria, and whether it could indeed be a preparatory drawing for the Barberini Harp is also the subject of Ursula Verena Fischer Pace's article [Designs for Musical Instruments](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/research/disegni-per-strumenti-musicali/ "Designs for Musical Instruments").

With the generous support of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz – Max-Planck-Institut and Istituto Storico Austriaco. Special thanks to Eike Schmidt, Laura Donati and Fabrizio Paolucci at the Uffizi.
