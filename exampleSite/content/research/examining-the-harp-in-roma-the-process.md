In December 2018, wood scientists <span id="person_tag">Volker Haag</span> and <span id="person_tag">Valentina Zemke</span> from the [Thünen-Institut](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/indextag#Th%C3%BCnen-Institut), [Institut für Holzforschung](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/indextag#Institut%20f%C3%BCr%20Holzforschung) transported comprehensive microscopy equipment from [Hamburg](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/map#Hamburg) to [Roma](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/map#Roma) for this investigation. At the heart of this equipment is a state-of-the-art [3D-RLM](https://harfenlabor.netlify.app/indextag#3D-RLM) (3D-reflected-light microscopy) microscope for a completely non-destructive material analysis that allows identification of the types of wood that the harp was built of. The scientists’ repertoire of tools also includes a custom computer with specialist image analysis software, as well as various eyepieces and stands for different applications. This video provides an account of this process. Haag and Zemke were supported in this process by the wood scientist <span id="person_tag">Swati Tamantini</span> of the Università degli Studi della Tuscia, DIBAF (Viterbo).

In February 2019, the scientists shared their findings with Harfenlabor in the [Thünen-Institut Wood Species Identification Report](https://www.harfenlabor.com/research/thunen-wood-species-identification-report/).
