barberiniharpproject = "The Barberini Harp is the most important surviving Italian Baroque harp. This chromatic harp with three parallel rows of strings was constructed in 1632-33 for the harpist Marco Marazzoli by the instrument maker Girolamo Acciari and the woodcarver Giovanni Tubi under the patronage of Cardinal Antonio Barberini. \n\nAs we still lack crucial understanding of this famous harp, Harfenlabor’s Barberini Harp Project intends to share and initiate research on this harp in the fields of organology, musicology, and performance practice. \n\nThis publication presents three stages of the Barberini Harp Project: Convening in Roma in 2016, Interviews with Experts, and Examinations.\n"
description = "Practical Examination of the Barberini Harp&&\nEric Kleinmann, harp maker&&\n&&\nRenowned master historical harp builder Eric Kleinmann presents his research and examination of the Barberini Harp in preparation for construction of a facsimile. He observed changes to the neck of the original harp: What were the consequences? One of them is string length—Kleinmann made a small harp to test the presumed original stringing and the current stringing. Examinations revealed the harp’s neck had been hollowed out since it was originally made: Why? In addition, cracks were found in gilding, and a later addition of decoration has been found to disturb the lowest strings; and unexplained pinholes do not correspond to soundboard holes. Based on his examination, Kleinmann believes that the soundboard is not original. Dendrochronological examination found that the wood for it was growing between 1341–1644, before and during the Little Ice Age. The soundboard was made with wood grown up until 1605. 360-degree camera footage from inside the neck revealed repairs labels on the inside; some strange objects were found inside the soundbox. The ties on the harp are exquisitely crafted and a little unusual. Finally, Kleinmann is convinced that the column could not have been made in walnut wood. He has subsequently been proven wrong by Volker Haag and the two are now planning to collaborate on the issues arising from examinations."

As part of continued research within the <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini Harp Project</span>, Harfenlabor invited master historical harp maker <span id="person_tag">Eric Kleinmann</span> to reflect on his findings following decades of research into, and practical examinations of the <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini Harp</span>. Harfenlabor also commissioned Kleinmann to build a small-scale model of the top of the harp for experiments with stringing, and present his conclusions at the <span id="subjects_tag">Convening around the Barberini Harp</span>, a symposium organised by Harfenlabor that took place on December 14-16, 2016, at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali and at the Istituto Storico Austriaco, Roma.
