This article focuses on a painting by Giovanni Lanfranco that is today on display at the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini (fig. 1), <sup>1</sup> depicting a harp very similar to the one usually referred to as the Barberini Harp,<sup>2</sup> today at the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali in Roma (fig. 2). It had long been thought that the Barberini family commissioned the painter Giovanni Lanfranco to produce the painting, until it was discovered that it had, in fact, been bequeathed to Antonio Barberini by the famous harpist, composer and singer Marco Marazzoli.<sup>3</sup> This article intends to, first of all, provide insights into the painting with particular regard to the representation of the harp, and to offer a more precise consideration as to when this painting was created. Later, we intend to analyse the painting inside Marazzoli's home by relating it to other paintings exhibited there.

**1)** The painting and Marazzoli

The humanist Sabba Castiglione writes in his Memoirs, published in 1575 about musical instruments adorning the homes of many people, "what ornaments I certainly commend, because these instruments delight the ear greatly, and greatly recreate the souls, which, as Plato said, remember the harmony arising from the motions of heavenly circles: more so, they please the eye, when they come from the hands of diligent and excellent masters.”<sup>4</sup> The importance of a \[musical\] instrument as an object not only to be played, but also to be looked at, gains strength in the following century, to the extent that the famous theorist Giovanni Battista Doni writes in his treatise on scenic music: “Therefore, in order to make the instruments appear to the gaze of the people, it is fitting to ensure that they have a beautiful and graceful appearance \[…\] because a gilded harp makes for a beautiful sight, and its sound is heard and better joins the human voice; and, in short, it has more greatness and nobility than keyboard instruments \[...\].””<sup>5</sup> And it is, perhaps, the fact the instruments are represented in paintings (and what paintings if we consider the one \[owned\] by Marazzoli!) that makes the importance of the aesthetics of these objects plainer yet. Lanfranco's painting depicts a woman enveloped up to her waist in ample, voluminous blue cloth. She is playing a double harp, its column carved and gilded, her face turned towards the viewer in the act of singing. To her right, in the background, two winged cupids join her in singing, reading from a sheet of music, while a large red brocade cloth on her left backgrounds the scene. The subject \[of the painting\] itself is interesting. What is it about?
