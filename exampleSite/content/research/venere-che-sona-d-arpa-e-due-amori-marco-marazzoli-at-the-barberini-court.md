This article focuses on a painting by Giovanni Lanfranco that is today on display at the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica di Palazzo Barberini (fig. 1), <sup>1</sup> depicting a harp very similar to the one usually referred to as the Barberini Harp,<sup>2</sup> today at the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali in Roma (fig. 2). It had long been thought that the Barberini family commissioned the painter Giovanni Lanfranco to produce the painting, until it was discovered that it had, in fact, been bequeathed to Antonio Barberini by the famous harpist, composer and singer Marco Marazzoli.<sup>3</sup> This article intends to, first of all, provide insights into the painting with particular regard to the representation of the harp, and to offer a more precise consideration as to when this painting was created. Later, we intend to analyse the painting inside Marazzoli's home by relating it to other paintings exhibited there.

**1)** The painting and Marazzoli

The humanist Sabba Castiglione writes in his Memoirs, published in 1575 about musical instruments adorning the homes of many people, "what ornaments I certainly commend, because these instruments delight the ear greatly, and greatly recreate the souls, which, as Plato said, remember the harmony arising from the motions of heavenly circles: more so, they please the eye, when they come from the hands of diligent and excellent masters.”<sup>4</sup> The importance of a \[musical\] instrument as an object not only to be played, but also to be looked at, gains strength in the following century, to the extent that the famous theorist Giovanni Battista Doni writes in his treatise on scenic music: “Therefore, in order to make the instruments appear to the gaze of the people, it is fitting to ensure that they have a beautiful and graceful appearance \[…\] because a gilded harp makes for a beautiful sight, and its sound is heard and better joins the human voice; and, in short, it has more greatness and nobility than keyboard instruments \[...\].””<sup>5</sup> And it is, perhaps, the fact the instruments are represented in paintings (and what paintings if we consider the one \[owned\] by Marazzoli!) that makes the importance of the aesthetics of these objects plainer yet. Lanfranco's painting depicts a woman enveloped up to her waist in ample, voluminous blue cloth. She is playing a double harp, its column carved and gilded, her face turned towards the viewer in the act of singing. To her right, in the background, two winged cupids join her in singing, reading from a sheet of music, while a large red brocade cloth on her left backgrounds the scene. The subject \[of the painting\] itself is interesting. What is it about?

Before Franca Trinchieri Camiz recognised it as mentioned in Marco Marazzoli's will,<sup>6</sup> the painting was considered as an allegory of music or simply “music.'”<sup>7</sup> Marazzoli, the first owner of the painting, describes it as “Venere che suona d’arpa e due Amori” \[Venus playing the harp with two cupids\].<sup>8</sup> That this is Venus is demonstrated only by two cupids in the background, as the woman \[depicted\] has no attributes that would characterise her as Venus. The iconography of Venus as a musician is certainly unusual. Even as it is true that \[depictions of Venus\] connect \[her\] with music, for example, in Titian’s famous painting _Venere e il suonatore di Organo_ \[_Venus and the Organ Player_\] (fig. 3), Venus herself is rarely represented in the act of playing. Among other things, it is worth noting that Marazzoli's _Venus_ loses its connotation the moment it enters the Barberini collections, where it was inventoried from 1671 simply as a “large lifelike woman playing the harp semi-nude, by Cav. Lanfranco.”<sup>9</sup> The painting could be in relation to the representations of Venetian women (often courtesans), particularly in vogue in the 1500s, depicted playing an instrument, usually a lute. They often assumed characteristics of Venus, goddess of love, by virtue of the erotic character of the image. Just like in the Venetian paintings, the woman is very 'true'; her hairstyle is fashioned in the way we find in other works from the early 1730s (fig. 4). The clogs, often worn by courtesans, and the earrings are elements contributing to the sensuous character of the figure. The same goes for musical activity, as music has been since antiquity considered capable of arousing strong emotions, especially if interpreted by a woman.<sup>10</sup> 

Apart from the subject matter, it is also the theatricality of the composition that makes the painting stand out: the red cloth evoking a curtain, harp in the foreground, woman’s gaze turned to the viewer as if performing her music exclusively for him. Most conspicuous is the predominance of the instrument, which is very similar to the Barberini harp.<sup>11</sup> The presence of the instrument in the painting is justified precisely because the painting belonged to the famous harpist Marco Marazzoli. Not only was he the owner of the painting, but the harp depicted in it was in his possession, even if it actually belonged to his patron Cardinal Antonio Barberini. The latter's inventory of 1636-44, mentions, in fact, "a large gilded carved harp with its strings in Marco Marazzoli's hands”<sup>12</sup> one that reappears in the last will and inventory of the musician. Some documents in the Barberini Archive also attest that Antonio Barberini had commissioned a harp for the musician Marco Marazzoli in 1632-33, and paid a total of around 125 _scudi_ for it.<sup>13</sup> Among these documents there is also a tool description provided by the carver that coincides with \[the carving work on\] the harp depicted by Lanfranco. One can imagine that this important and expensive instrument, made especially for the harpist, provided the inspiration for the painting, which probably would have been painted between 1633 – when the harp was made – and 1634 – when the painter Giovanni Lanfranco left Roma. This appears even clearer once we consider the leading role the harp assumes in the painting, the theatrical representation of it as almost bursting towards the viewer, turned to the side for a position that brings the carved column clearly into view.

**1) The painting inside Marazzoli’s home**

Marazzoli's relationship with the Barberini family began shortly after his arrival in Roma from Parma, his hometown, in 1626, probably following Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini.<sup>14</sup> The earliest documents attesting to his service at the Barberini court date back to 1629 and concern the harp maintenance costs.<sup>15</sup> Indeed, he must have been known as a harpist, so much so that he was referred to in documents as "Marco dell’arpa." His rise within the Barberini circle and at the papal court is attested in his role of “bussolante”[\[1\]](applewebdata://BC92F5AC-4AB5-482F-8839-FE0AC2062DA6#_ftn1) conferred on him by the pope – Urbano VIII Barberini – in 1634. That same year he took part in the music performance at the Giostra del Saracino (Saracen Joust), a knightly tournament; Marazzoli can perhaps be identified as the harpist depicted on the ship of Bacchus (fig. 5). In addition, Marazzoli had a number of roles in his service to Antonio Barberini, Urban VIII’s nephew. Marazzoli is documented in 1637 as “aiutante di camera,” a year later among the virtuosos of the family, and from 1639 as a "musician." The same year he became a part of the Pontifical chapel as a “cantore soprannumerario,” to become a full member in 1640. And it was precisely at the end of the 1930s that Marazzoli began composing music for theatrical operas OR WORKS? for the Barberini. This work was interrupted by the death of Urban VIII in 1644 and the consequent departure of his nephews for France, only to resume upon their return to Roma in 1653, the year of the Barberini's reconciliation with Pope Innocent X.[\[2\]](applewebdata://BC92F5AC-4AB5-482F-8839-FE0AC2062DA6#_ftn2) Marazzoli’s bond with the Barberinis persisted throughout the life of this musician until his death in Roma in 1662.

Altre opere sono _Il_ _Giudizio della Ragione_ (1643); _Dal Male il Bene_ (1653); _L’armi e gli Amori_(1654, ma andata in scena nel ’55) e _La Vita Umana_ (1656), dramma allegorico dalle scenografie sfarzose composto in onore dell’arrivo di Cristina di Svezia a Roma.
