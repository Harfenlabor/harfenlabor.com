+++
Harpist and researcher Mara Galassi and master luthier Dario Pontiggia are In Dario Pontiggia’s workshop in Milano, with a copy of the Barberini Harp he built for Galassi, discussing some of the finer points of organology in relation to copies of historical harps. Galassi, one of the pioneers in the field of historical harp organological research, commissioned the first copy ever made of the Barberini Harp from the luthier David Brown. Galassi and Pontiggia have since collaborated on several replicas of the harp, affording deep consideration to various issues affecting any attempt to produce a facsimile of a historical instrument, especially one as old and enigmatic as the Barberini Harp. Galassi and Pontiggia live in the same city and their collaboration has influenced their respective approaches to their own disciplines. In this interview, a disagreement over aspects of the Barberini Harp produces an insight into how building copies as close to the original as possible could yield additional knowledge of historical performance practice, harp technique and buon gusto of the period. Chiara Granata provides Scientific Commentary on the ensuing debate in [Sol di corde soavi armo le dita? Only music I carry as my weapon? Different ways to use the same instrument]()
