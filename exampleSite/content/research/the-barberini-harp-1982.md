###### This double photo story brings images of the <span id="subjects_tag">Barberini Harp</span> made at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali some thirty years apart. In the meantime, the harp was restored and is now displayed under more controlled conditions. <span id="person_tag">Mara Galassi</span>'s analogue images are followed by digital images taken in 2014 by <span id="person_tag">Armin Linke</span>.

###### Between 1985 and 1986, the harpist and researcher Mara Galassi travelled twice to <span id="map_tag">Roma</span> from <span id="map_tag">Palermo</span>, where she was the principal harpist at the Teatro Massimo to photograph the Barberini Harp. In Palermo, Galassi was exposed to Sicilian Renaissance music, marking her turn to lifelong study and performance of Early music. Curious about the famous Barberini Harp, Galassi decided to see the instrument and document her visit. This took place shortly before the first Early Harp conference in <span id="map_tag">Basel</span> (1986), at which Galassi presented the images of the Barberini Harp shown below. The founder of the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali, Prof. <span id="person_tag">Luisa Cervelli</span>, was the director of the museum at the time. These images are also closely linked to the making of the first copy of the Barberini Harp by luthier David Brown for Galassi, in 1990.

###### In 2014, the historical harpist Margret Köll invited Armin Linke to take images of the Barberini Harp as part of her research into Baroque harp, in particular the Barberini Harp and the repertoire for it. The then director of the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali in Roma, Dr. <span id="person_tag">Sandra Suatoni</span> kindly allowed for the harp to be removed from its protective glass box and photographed. In the museum room housing the harp there also hangs a large composite X-ray image of the instrument. The Barberini Harp can no longer be played for reasons of conservation; we do not know when it was last played. Today we can only look at this instrument as an object of Baroque culture, politics and aesthetics. We can but hypothesise as to its sound.
