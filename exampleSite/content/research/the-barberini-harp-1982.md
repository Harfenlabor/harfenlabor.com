This double photo story brings images of the Barberini Harp made at the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali some thirty years apart. In the meantime, the harp was restored and is now displayed under more controlled conditions. Sometime in 1985 or 1986, the harpist and researcher Mara Galassi travelled to Roma from Palermo, where she was the principal harpist at the Teatro Massimo. In Palermo, Galassi was exposed to Sicilian Renaissance music, marking her turn to lifelong study and performance of Early music. Curious about the famous Barberini Harp, Galassi decided to see the instrument and photograph it. This took place shortly before the first Early Harp conference in Basel (1986), at which Galassi presented the images of the Barberini Harp shown below. Galassi's analogue images are followed by images taken in 2014 by Armin Linke, at Margret Köll's instigation.

###### This is the part that, on any harp that is being played, bears the marks of contact with player's arm and shoulder: the lacquer rubs off. We also see the stave construction of the soundbox, and we can just about see the curve of the soundboard, made of bent wood. Barberini Harp, Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali, Roma, 1987.

###### In 2014, the historical harpist Margret Köll invited Armin Linke to take images of the Barberini Harp as part of her research into Baroque harp, in particular the Barberini Harp and the repertoire for it. The then director of the Museo Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali in Roma, Dr. Sandra Suatoni kindly allowed for the harp to be removed from its protective glass box and photographed. In the museum room housing the harp there also hangs a large composite X-ray image of the instrument. The Barberini Harp can no longer be played for reasons of conservation; we do not know when it was last played. Today we can only look at this instrument as an object of Baroque culture, politics and aesthetics. We can but hypothesise as to its sound.
