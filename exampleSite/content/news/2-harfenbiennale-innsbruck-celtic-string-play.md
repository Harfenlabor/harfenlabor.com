Unfolding under the motto “Celtic String Play”, the 2. Harfenbiennale Innsbruck invites you to listen to the next generation in concert, discover Austrian premieres as well as a world premiere, explore exciting lectures, lecture-concerts as well as purely musical events presenting international and local soloists and ensembles. Click on Harfenbiennale.com to peruse this year’s programme and find ticketing information.

The second Harfenbiennale presents a fascinating range of harp types—from the Celtic and Welsh harps to the Scottish and Irish ones. Moreover, it will unveil a hitherto unknown jewel, the Lyrichord, the creation of which can be traced back to the visionary mind of Leonardo da Vinci.
