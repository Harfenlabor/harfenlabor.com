			<p style="margin-bottom: 4rem; line-break: normal;"><strong>Harfenlabor</strong><br><br>Harfenlabor is a platform for critical and open discourse on topics related to the enigma of Historical Harp. This instrument was only revived around 35 years ago—it has not so far received the attention it is due in the music world and beyond, and it is largely invisible to a wider audience.<br>
			Already active as an analogue network, Harfenlabor has been initiating research and gathering musicologists, scientists, conductors, singers, instrumentalists, harp makers, string makers, and others through regular workshops, masterclasses, lectures, symposia, and concerts to study and reflect on sources, train in historical harp skills, research the repertory for the harp, as well as commission contemporary works for historical instruments.<br>
			Harfenlabor will present and disseminate this valuable content on these pages, its digital edition: a comprehensive, immersive, searchable resource of scientific and artistic research on Historical Harp. This approach reflects Harfenlabor’s research process: individual research results are first shared and discussed in a smaller, analogue circle of a Convening. This process opens new directions for Interviews and Examinations as the second level of research resulting in new contributions. Following careful evaluation, review and scrutiny, the outcomes of this research process become Harfenlabor’s digital content. Scientific commentaries aim to provoke cross-disciplinary thinking and consider the still open research questions and propose new directions. Harfenlabor aims to strengthen the transfer of these advances to new generations of musicians and researchers. Harfenlabor was initiated and founded by Margret Köll in 2016.<br></p>
